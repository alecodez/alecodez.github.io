        <p> My name is Alessio, i'm 16 (actually 15 but i have birthday in a month so wtv) and I do coding stuff. <br> I learned <b> all </b> by myself cuz I like to torture myself and I know how to code in a few coding languages. <br> I feel like I am at least <b> one </b> of these things: <br> <br>

            <ul>
                <li> A Web Dev </li>
                <li> A Programmer </li>
                <li> A dumbahh (probably lmao) </li>
            </ul> <br>
        </p>

        <h2 id = "interests" > My Interests!!</h2>
        <img src = "imagery/images/cs1.png" alt = "cities:skylines">

        <p class = "p-interests"> I could define myself as a quite interesting person actually!! <br> I could consider myself a <b> gamer </b> and also a free time <b> Web Dev</b>!! <br> I learned it all by myself by using a website called <a href = "https://w3schools.com" _blank> W3Schools </a>, which is very peak as it explains <b> very </b> well the concepts of each language n stuff!! <br> I really reccomend it!! <br> <br> My fav games are: <br> <br>
            <ul> 
                <li> Cities Skylines 2 </li>
                <li> Cities: Skylines (<b> my fav one ^^</b>) </li>
                <li> Minecraft </li>
                <li> Roblox</li>
                <li> The Sims 3 </li>
                <li> Euro Truck Simulator 2 </li>
                <li> Garry's Mod </li>
            </ul> <br>
            (that's pretty much it) </p> <br>

        <h2 id = "animes" class = "info-anime"> My Anime List!! </h2>

        <img src = "imagery/images/Spy_×_Family_logo.png" alt = "SpyXFamily Logo">

        <p> I know you wouldn't expect that from me but, i'm actually kind of an anime person. My friend introduced me to anime last year and now, when i have the will, I watch some animes or start new ones!! <br> 
            The animes that i've watched so far aren't that much, but they are very <b> peak</b> in my opinion honestly. <br>

            The animes i've watched so far are: <br>

            <ul>
                <li> Neon Genesis Evangelion (first one <b> ever </b>) </li>
                <li> Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood (second one) </li>
                <li> SpyXFamily (currently watching)</li>
            </ul> <br>

            As you might have noticed, I've put the SpyXFamily Logo below the title of this paragraph for a simple reason: <b> IT'S BEEN ONE OF MY FAVORITE ONES SO FAR!! </b> <br>
            I simply like it because of the <b> story, character <i> development </i>, and most importantly <u> the setting </u>!!</b>. I really liked it because it's situated in a dark era of Germany, and it shows the hate between the DDR and BRD in a fictional way. I really appreciated this. 
            </p> <br>
