          <p> <b> PHP </b> is one of the first coding languages i've <i> actually </i> learned quite well!! <br>
            It hasn't been a huge issue learning it, as I've used proper documentation and I applied it in very well made projects, all coded by myself!! <br> 
            People normally sh!t on it for it being <q> bad </q> and <q> unsecure </q> but in my opinion it isn't that bad actually. I don't think it deserves the hate. <br>
            It's code is understandable, and its <b> OOP</b> side too! I really like it honestly.

            <h2 id = "SQL"> SQL </h2> <br>
            <img src = "imagery/images/sql.png" alt = "SQL coding image"> <br>

            <p><b> SQL </b> is the second coding language I learned after PHP. I learned it in order to work with <i> databases</i> and to make my work as good as possible!! <br>
            I really like it because it's a language that is easy to understand, as it relies on english plain words!!
